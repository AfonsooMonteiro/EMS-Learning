MQTT Protocolos


Works by publishing and subscribing mechanism 
MQTT Broker is responsible for receiving all the messages, decides who is interestes in them and publishes to subcribers 

Imaginig a Shell Power plant where on Area 1 (A1) we have an instrument to measure temperature.
The A1 (Client) published the information to the broker. 

On MQTT there is this structure:  
      Topic: Shell/A1/Temp
      Msg or Payload: 32ÂºC  

MQTT broker can have all information published by the Sensor A1 , Sensor A2, Sensor A3.

The clients that are subscribed to Sensor A1, receive the info when Sensor A1 publishes to the MQTT broker. 

For cybersecurity point of view is used a firewall which only allows comunication between broker and the client.
