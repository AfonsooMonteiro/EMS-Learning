## **üí° Tips for Success**

1. **Track hours weekly:** 5‚Äì7h/week ‚Üí ~1h/day on weekdays or 2h/day on weekends.
2. **Set mini-goals:** Each week has a clear mini-project or milestone.
3. **Document everything:** Use GitHub for all simulations, screenshots, and dashboards ‚Äî this becomes your portfolio.
4. **Combine theory + practice:** Don‚Äôt just watch videos ‚Äî replicate examples and then modify them.
5. **Certificates:** Download as soon as you finish each course module to avoid losing access.

If you want, I can **also make a visual ‚ÄúGantt-style‚Äù chart** with **weeks, courses, certification checkpoints, and project tasks** ‚Äî this makes it easier to follow at a glance and stick to deadlines.

Do you want me to make that visual roadmap for you?
